# Here‚Äôs a list of **Selenium automation practical interview questions** commonly asked by top MNCs like **TCS, Infosys, Accenture, Capgemini, Cognizant, HCL, Tech Mahindra, and others**. These questions test both your **hands-on coding skills** and your **conceptual understanding**. I've grouped them into categories for clarity:
#

#
# ### üîß **Core Selenium Coding Tasks**
#
# These are hands-on tasks often asked during live coding rounds or take-home assignments:
#
# 1. **Write a Selenium script to log in to a website using credentials from a file (Excel/JSON/Properties).**
# 2. **Handle a dynamic dropdown using Selenium.**
# 3. **Write code to select a date from a date picker widget (e.g., book a ticket).**
# 4. **Write a script to take a screenshot when a test case fails.**
# 5. **How do you handle alerts and popups in Selenium? Show with example.**
# 6. **Write code to handle multiple windows and switch to a specific one based on title.**
# 7. **Write a script to upload a file using Selenium (without using AutoIT or Robot).**
# 8. **How do you implement explicit waits in Selenium? Give a real-time use case.**
# 9. **Write a script to scrape all product names and prices from an e-commerce website page.**
# 10. **Write a Selenium test case to verify that a button is enabled only after filling all required form fields.**

#
# ### üß™ **Framework & TestNG / Pytest / JUnit Integration**
#
# Framework knowledge is essential in most MNC interviews:
#
# 11. **How do you design a Page Object Model (POM) framework in Selenium? Show a class structure.**
# 12. **Explain how you integrated Selenium with TestNG or Pytest in your project.**
# 13. **Write a Data-Driven Test (DDT) using TestNG and Excel.**
# 14. **How do you run multiple test cases in parallel using TestNG/XML or Pytest-xdist?**
# 15. **How do you manage locators (XPath, CSS) centrally in your framework?**
#

#
# ### üåê **XPath and CSS Selectors Challenges**
#
# XPath logic is tested in almost every Selenium round:
#
# 16. **Write an XPath to select the last row of a table.**
# 17. **Write XPath to find a sibling element of a specific label.**
# 18. **How to locate an element whose ID is dynamic and changes every time the page is loaded?**
# 19. **Write XPath for an anchor tag containing partial text and a specific attribute.**
# 20. **Write CSS Selector for an element with multiple classes and an attribute filter.**
#

#
# ### üîÑ **Scenario-Based Questions**
#
# These questions test your thought process and debugging skill:
#
# 21. **You click a button but nothing happens. How do you debug the issue using Selenium?**
# 22. **A button is not interactable (ElementNotInteractableException). How will you handle it?**
# 23. **In your CI/CD pipeline, Selenium tests are failing randomly. What could be the root cause and solution?**
# 24. **Your script works on Chrome but fails on Firefox. How do you debug and fix it?**
# 25. **How do you identify stale elements? Give an example and explain your fix.**

#
# ### ‚öôÔ∏è **Tool Integration and Advanced Concepts**
#
# If the role involves DevOps or test architecture, expect these:
#
# 26. **How do you integrate Selenium with Jenkins? Explain the steps.**
# 27. **How do you generate an HTML report of Selenium test runs?**
# 28. **How do you use Selenium Grid to run tests on different browsers and OS combinations?**
# 29. **How do you handle CAPTCHA or OTP in test automation?**
# 30. **Explain a real-time challenge you faced while working with Selenium and how you resolved it.**

#
# ### üìå Tip:
#
# In MNC interviews like **TCS, HCL, Infosys**, they often ask:
#
# * To **explain your framework structure** from scratch.
# * Show usage of **waits**, **POM**, **exception handling**, and **parameterization**.
# * Sometimes even ask for a **live coding demo** or a **screen-share assignment**.
